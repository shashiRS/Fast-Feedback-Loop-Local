# E301, E302 ignore one/two blank line expected they are just annoying
# W503 ignore line breaks before binary operator (e.g. and, or) - we ignore this and not W504 for
#      better readability
# E741 is added since we use CLI parameter name as 'l' which is not allowed in pep8 to call in test.
# E741 can be removed from here.Once we stop using -l or re-naming
ignore = E301,E302,W503,E741

# PEP-9 defines 79. Since the test coverage is to mostly C++ code with extraLongClasses
# and JSON structures with long names also, we decided on 100. Modify accordingly.
max-line-length = 100
