# Service Desk Ticket System

For crashes or new feature requests it might be best to create a ticket so all the information is well stored.
To enable this a Service Desk for NEXT has been implemented. Feel free to add tickets [here](https://jira.auto.continental.cloud/plugins/servlet/desk/portal/1) as well.

* Tool/Process Area should be set to: **NEXT Simulation Framework (ADAS)**

If you have an attachment, that is bigger than what Jira allows (100 MB), you can add your attachments into our shared folder:
\\cw01.contiwan.com\Root\Loc\ulm2\didt6448\Recordings\sim_team_share\NEXT\ProblemReportAttachments

Please create a new folder there with a name matching your Jira Ticket ID.
If you donÂ´t have access to the location, you can access the Self Service Page here:
